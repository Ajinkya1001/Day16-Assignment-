//Create a Employee Bean class with following 3 fields: 
//int empId, String name, int salary. 
//Implement the Comparable interface within the Employee class and define the sorting logic according to the salary, and if 2 Employee salary is same then sort them according to their name. 
//Create a Main class with main method and inside the main class create a TreeSet class object which can hold multiple Employee object. 
//Add 5 Employee object with some dummy data and print each Each Employee object one by one from the TreeSet object.
